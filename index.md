# Machine Learning

## Here in this repo I am documenting my ML journey.
First, I started ML in the course-work of my CS syllabus in 3rd Year 5th Sem (2024 Aug-Dec)
- Our College course work covered mostly the mathematical aspect of machine learning. Here I have attached a syllabus.

- `TODO:` I will also add my ml codes I wrote in my course's Lab classes. Most of them are from scratch implementation of ML algos in python
- I am not that much fluent using PYTHON so I also learnt it and documented like this one. (`TODO:` Attach the repo here). Also for Data Science I learnt libraries like : `pandas`, `numpy`, `mathplotlib`, `scikit-learn` etc.
