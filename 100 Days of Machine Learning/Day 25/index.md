Normalization is a technique often applied as a part of data preparation for machine learning. The goal of normalization is to change the values of numeric columns in the dataset to use a common scale, without distorting differences in the ranges of values or losing information

### Types:
- Min Max Scaling
- Mean Normalization
- Max Absolute Scaling
- Robust Scaling
